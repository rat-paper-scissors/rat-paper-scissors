# About
Hello, I'm just a 🐀 that develops games under this moniker. I make modern games using Godot and actual GameBoy games using GB Studio. I also make pixel art and often release assets that I make for my projects for free. Check out my projects over at [RatPaperScissors.com](https://www.ratpaperscissors.com).
